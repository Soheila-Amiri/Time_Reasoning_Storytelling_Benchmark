The objective of this benchmark and project is to evaluate the temporal understanding of state-of-the-art large language models in storytelling tasks. The benchmark dataset consists of samples containing 2â€“3 images, each paired with a storyline, where each image represents a key event. We design test cases with varying temporal orders of these events to assess whether the models can correctly identify the proper sequence of events in the story.
